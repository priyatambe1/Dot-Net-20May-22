        one for Drive of type void and another for Refuel of type bool that has 
       a parameter of type integer with the amount of gasoline to refuel. 
       Then create a Car class with a builder that receives a parameter with the car's starting gasoline amount 
       and implements the Drive and Refuel methods of the car.

    The Drive method will print on the screen that the car is Driving,
    if the gasoline is greater than 0. The Refuel method will increase the gasoline of the car and return true.

    To carry out the tests, create an object of type Car with 0 of gasoline in the Main of the program 
    and ask the user for an amount of gasoline to refuel, finally execute the Drive method of the car   */
